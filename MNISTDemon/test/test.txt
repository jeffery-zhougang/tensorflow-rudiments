"""Definition of 512 VGG-based SSD network.

This model was initially introduced in:
SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector
Wei Liu, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Christian Szegedy, Scott Reed,
Cheng-Yang Fu, Alexander C. Berg
https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325

'Two variants of the model are defined: the 300x300 and 512x512 models, the'
latter obtaining a slightly better accuracy on Pascal VOC.

Usage:
    with slim.arg_scope(ssd_vgg.ssd_vgg()):
        outputs, end_points = ssd_vgg.ssd_vgg(inputs)
